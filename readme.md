# Overview

The purpose of this project is to assist members of an on-campus a cappella group search for musical repertoire stored on Google Drive. Given that the repertoire is publicly available to users via link, the application stores the musical repertoire links in a database and provides a regex-based search tool for titles in the Google Drive.

# Tasks
- [x] Implemented basic search, registration, and login functionality.
- [x] Implemented MongoDB database interactions.
- [ ] Deployed to DigitalOcean Droplet.
- [ ] Non-admin input features, including user-friendly means of adding repertoire entries to database.

More tasks may be added as time goes on.

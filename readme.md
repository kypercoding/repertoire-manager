# Overview

The purpose of this project is to assist members of an on-campus a cappella group search for musical repertoire stored on Google Drive. Given that the repertoire is publicly available to users via link, the application stores the musical repertoire links in a database and provides a regex-based search tool for titles in the Google Drive.
